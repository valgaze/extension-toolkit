# Extension Toolkit Project Overview

This project is a toolkit for building interactive extensions with React and TypeScript. The main components are:

## Core Structure
- `src/` - Contains all extension implementations and core utilities
- `util/` - Shared utilities and helper functions
- `docs/` - Project documentation
- `.storybook/` - Storybook configuration for component development

## Key Extensions
The project includes several pre-built extensions:
- [StarRaterExtension](mdc:src/StarRaterExtension/Extension.tsx) - Interactive star rating component
- [ToastExtension](mdc:src/ToastExtension) - Notification system
- [FormExtension](mdc:src/FormExtension) - Form handling and validation
- [VideoExtension](mdc:src/VideoExtension) - Video player functionality
- [RecorderExtension](mdc:src/RecorderExtension) - Audio/video recording capabilities

## Development Guidelines
1. All extensions should be built using React and TypeScript
2. Use Zod for input/output validation
3. Follow the extension pattern established in existing components
4. Include proper documentation and type definitions
5. Implement proper error handling and loading states

## Getting Started
1. Check the [README.md](mdc:README.md) for setup instructions
2. Review [when-to-use.md](mdc:when-to-use.md) for best practices
3. Use Storybook for component development and testing
