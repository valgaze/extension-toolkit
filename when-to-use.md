When to use Widget vs. Conversation Design:

USE A WIDGET WHEN:

1. Complex Visual Selection

ex.

- Seat maps for flights/venues
- Calendar date picking
- Color selection
- Anything where "picking from a grid" beats "describing in words"
- When "I'll take seat 14C" is better than "Which seat would you like?"

2. Multi-Variable Input

ex.

- Insurance quote with 5+ fields
- Vacation package with multiple choices
- When "Fill this quick form" beats 20 conversation turns

3. Real-time Validation & Feedback

ex.

- Credit card input with live validation
- Password strength checking
- When immediate visual feedback matters

4. Native Device Features

ex.

- Camera scan for documents
- Location picker for delivery
- Biometric auth
- When you need device capabilities (ie bluetooth, camera, etc)

5. Complex Data Visualization

ex.

- Displaying trends or graphs
- Comparing multiple options side by side
- When "seeing the data" beats "hearing about it"

STICK WITH CONVERSATION WHEN:

1. Simple Choices

- Yes/no questions
- Pick from 2-3 options
- When "Would you like X or Y?" works fine

2. Natural Language Input

- Name entry
- Open feedback
- When typing/speaking naturally feels right

3. Linear Flows

- Basic ordering
- Simple appointment booking
- When step-by-step chat works well

4. Emotional/Support Interactions

- Customer service
- Problem resolution
- When human-like interaction matters

5. Progressive Disclosure

- Complex information that needs to be broken down
- Educational content
- When information needs to be digested in chunks
